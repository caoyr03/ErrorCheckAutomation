## Motivation

Quantitative and qualitative commentaries are reported to senior management and high level consolidated comments are provided within financial disclosures. Business controllers rely on analytics to perform sanity check and understand moves, such as fair value leveling, balance sheet geography and associate changes with market conditions. Currently, fair value leveling and seasonal inventory system commentary is conducted by manual process. Check and cross-reference between database requires large amount of repetitive work. Thus, an automated error check tool would be helpful to perform an assessment of appropriateness of fair value leveling and outline the addition of new accounts, unusual activity.

## Dataset

The mock-up data has 3 datatable sheets.
